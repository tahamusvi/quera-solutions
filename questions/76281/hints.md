**how is it different to inherit from User or AbastractUser while making the user model in django**

When creating a custom user model in Django, you have two main options: inheriting from User (django.contrib.auth.models.User) or AbstractUser (django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractUser). Here's a breakdown of the differences between the two approaches:
Inheriting from User:
By inheriting from User, you are extending the built-in user model and can add additional fields or methods. The existing fields and behavior of User will be preserved in your custom model.
Your custom model will have all the default user fields like username, email, password, etc.
However, there are limitations when extending User. For example, you cannot modify any of the existing fields or change the model's unique constraints.
Inheriting from AbstractUser:
AbstractUser is an abstract model that provides the basic structure and fields for a user model. By inheriting from AbstractUser, you are creating a custom user model with full control over the fields and behavior.
You can define your own user fields and methods without being constrained by the default User model.
AbstractUser requires you to define the username field and the email field if you use email as a unique identifier. You can also define any additional fields as per your project requirements.
Using AbstractUser gives you more flexibility when creating a custom user model, but it also means you need to manage the user authentication process more manually compared to extending the User model.
In conclusion, the choice between inheriting from User or AbstractUser depends on your specific use case and the level of customization you need for your user model. If you want a simple extension of the existing User model, inherit from User. If you need more control over the fields and behavior of the user model, inherit from AbstractUser.



**get_or_create**
The get_or_create method in Django is a built-in method provided by Django's Model Managers. It's a combination of a get and a create method that allows you to retrieve an object from the database based on certain parameters, or create a new one if it doesn't exist yet.
The method signature for get_or_create looks like this:
python
Copy
get_or_create(defaults=None, **kwargs)
Here's what it does:
Filtering: It first tries to retrieve an object from the database using the keyword arguments (**kwargs) provided. These arguments represent the fields you want to filter by.
Creating: If no object is found with the given parameters, get_or_create will create a new object using the provided keyword arguments (**kwargs) and the additional optional keyword arguments (defaults) which are used to set field values for the new object.
The method returns a tuple with two elements:
The object that was either retrieved from the database or created.
A boolean indicating whether the object was created (True) or not (False).
Here's an example of how to use get_or_create:
python
Copy
team, created = Team.objects.get_or_create(name='My Team', defaults={'some_field': 'value'})
In this example, get_or_create tries to find a Team object with the name 'My Team'. If it doesn't find one, it creates a new Team object with the provided name and sets some_field to 'value'. The team variable will hold the object, and created will be True if the object was created or False if it already existed and was just retrieved from the database.
