Aggregate functions in SQL are used to perform calculations on a set of values and return a single result. They operate on a group of rows, often in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause, to provide summary data or statistics about your dataset.


 The ['price__avg'] part in the code is used to access the result of the aggregate 
     function. Let's break it down further:
     Product.objects.aggregate(Avg('price')): This part calculates the average of the price field 
     for all the objects in the Product model. The aggregate() function returns a dictionary with 
     the results of the aggregate functions applied to the queryset.
     ['price__avg']: The result of the aggregate function is stored in a dictionary where the key 
     is formed by combining the field name (price) and the aggregate function used (__avg), 
     separated by a double underscore (__). So, the key price__avg refers to the average of the price field.





# values and values list



what is the difference between values() and list_values?
In Django, both values() and values_list() are methods used for retrieving specific fields
   from a queryset, but they have some differences in their behavior and the format of the
data they return.
values():
values() returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an object from
the queryset and contains the specified fields as key-value pairs.
Example:
```python
products = Product.objects.values('name', 'price')
This will return a queryset containing dictionaries like this:

[
    {'name': 'Product 1', 'price': 10},
    {'name': 'Product 2', 'price': 20},
    ...
]
```

values_list():
values_list() returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents an object from the
queryset and contains the specified fields' values.
By default, values_list() returns a list of tuples with the same length as the number of 
fields specified in the values_list() method. If you set the flat parameter to True, it will
return a single flat list containing the values of the specified fields.

```python

products = Product.objects.values_list('name', 'price')
This will return a queryset containing tuples like this:

[
    ('Product 1', 10),
    ('Product 2', 20),
    ...
]

```
If you use flat=True:

products = Product.objects.values_list('name', 'price', flat=True)
This will return a flat list like this:

```python
['Product 1', 10, 'Product 2', 20, ...]
```

In summary, values() returns dictionaries with key-value pairs for the specified fields,
 while values_list() returns a list of tuples (or a flat list if flat=True) containing the 
 values of the specified fields. The choice between the two depends on the desired data
 structure for further processing or displaying in your Django templates.




# Diffrence between aggregate and annotate
```python

#Annotating
products = Product.objects.annotate(
    average_price=Avg('price'),
    total_reviews=Count('reviews')
)
for product in products:
    print(product.average_price, product.total_reviews)



#Aggregating
product = Product.objects.aggregate(
     average_price=Avg('price'),
      total_reviews=Count('reviews')

)


print(product['average_price'], product['total_reviews'])

```
