## Question Description
The main focus of the project is on useing Shamsi or jalali(potato potato ...) in Djando, but there are some more challenges defining the models and writing functions to query and calculate some data. the last challenge is to build a nice interface for admin panel . 

## Approach
its neccesary to use jalali library to be able to use Shamsi calender inb django.
In the end a fresh mind is needed to complete the forms and models.
I didnt really know how to write the code for data validation in forms classes!
Converting the fullname into firstname and lastname only in the admin panel was new lesson.
I liked my approach to make a difference between what user sees and what is beingsaved to database

## Key Points
using jalali library, learing to write function within forms or admin or in models and being aware of how they really work

## Sample Code
```python
